## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

The biggest takeaway ever for me is that in my old job I was judged by getting just enough done to keep the operations running rather then the quality of my work. This has been a massive paradigm shift for me when learning how to be a strong learner. I love the programming and coding process. I absolutely love to teach others. This is essentially what I made my career off teaching in the first place. I want to focus on developing the skill rather then assuming my study skills are adequate. 

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
Boolean - Typically true or false outcomes
Number - a defined number or value 
Undefined - a Variable without an assigned value 
String - Series of Characters 


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hello World!")

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment? 

/* and */ I believe the value is to make a more readable code. 

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is a thing that you assign on the computer. What do call the seat that you can find at the park that I push you on? A SWING! 

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

The app I use the most is an app for fantasy premier league. This definitely containes numbers. There are constant calculations that are done when adding up points from each player. There are also strings used to combine multiple players into each trade. Finally, I have to imagine there are variables assigned to each team. This specific file related to this specific player. 

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

It is a series of values. If I had multiple numbers assigned to different values and wanted to total them, I can use this to do so. 

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

I was thinking about instagram and was considering how they write an algorithm to show you more items that you like to look at and click on. I was curious if this was an example of this. 

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

I am still a little baffled as to how you use these basic commands and strings to produce the Magic that happens on an app. haha. I have to imagine there is a ton more to it. I am most excited to learn it.
