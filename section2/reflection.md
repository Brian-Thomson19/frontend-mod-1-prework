## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I think I tent to make myself suffer a little too long. I sometimes will be stubborn since I am a repeater and wait too long to  be successful. I have become more and more comfortable reaching out to people and also too google for answers.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I felt that I struggled a bit with that. I am not sure if it impacted my learning either way. I definitely had to go back to session 1 and figure out how to do it again.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

Definitely looking at the weather daily. I imagine I click on weather and it brings up a number of different locations to see it. Or getting more specific, if i type in den, it pulls up all towns that might be den.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

You can use the operators && for "and", || for "or", and finally "not". The program will look at what is in () and try to estbalish an outcome.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
I think this question is refering to if or if else operators. You can use those along with {} to progress through a sequence of code.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

I know that there is a lot I don't know still. I guess I would love to know if I can use unlimited (&& and ||) in a single line of code.
